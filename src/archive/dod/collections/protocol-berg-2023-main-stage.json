    "desc": "powdr - a modular stack for zkVMs\n\n\nIn the recent months, there has been a surge in the popularity of zkVM implementations. Many of these use specialized solutions and code, sometimes even all the way down to the cryptography, which makes these zkVMs very monolithic and non-interoperable.\n\n\nPowdr takes a modular approach to designing and constructing zkVMs, employing multiple compilation and optimization stages to arrive at the final prover and verifier. Users can define custom instruction sets for a VM, specify how those compile to constraints, generate sub-machines and declare how to connect them. Moreover, the flexibility of powdr enables users to select from a variety of proving backends when generating the prover and verifier components.\n\n\nTo validate this concept, we have successfully developed a fully functional verifier that compiles (no-std) Rust code into eSTARK and Halo2 proofs via the RISC-V architecture. Additionally, we are currently working on adapting this verifier to wasm and Valida, VMs that take very different architectural approaches than RISC-V.\n\n\nChristian Reitwiessner is widely recognized for his substantial contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem, mainly for developing the smart contract language Solidity and improvements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Recently, his focus lies in advancing zero-knowledge technologies, particularly through his work on the powdr project.\n\n\nhttps://protocol.berlin",

Then I became interested in peer-to-peer systems, experimented with rust-libp2p and found that blockchains could play a major role in mitigating shortcomings of p2p systems.

With Polkadot's capability to adapt to its users'need, a new paradign for allocating coretime is being implemented by ecosystem teams. Coretime on the Polkadot UC is envisioned to be sold by the Polkadot System in two separate formats: Bulk Coretime and Instantaneous Coretime. When a Polkadot Core is utilized, we say it is dedicated to a \"Task\" rather than a \"parachain\". The Task to which a Core is dedicated may change at every Relay-chain block and while one predominant type of Task is to secure a Cumulus-based blockchain (i.e. a parachain), other types of Tasks are envisioned. Bulk Coretime is sold periodically on a specialised system chain known as the \"Coretime-chain\" and allocated in advance of its usage, whereas Instantaneous Coretime is sold on the Relay-chain immediately prior to usage on a block-by-block basis.\n\nGavin Wood\n\nhttps://protocol.berlin",

Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) is a new framework to enable on-demand horizontal scalability of Filecoin to meet web-scale application demands - unlocking an open data economy of composable subnets for scalable computation, fast data retrievals, application-specific gaming networks, and more on the Filecoin network.\n\nMolly Mackinlay leads Engineering and Research Development at Protocol Labs. This includes OSS stewardship across IPFS, Filecoin, and libp2p; designing and managing new breakthroughs like the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM); and helping launch new networks like Saturn (web3 CDN) and IPC (L2 subnets). Her work at PL also involves past roles as IPFS Project Lead and launching the Filecoin mainnet.

    "desc": "Protocol researchers and developers from distant ecosystems gather to talk about their blockspace.\n\n\n\nWe present a workshop centred around blockspace and its provision in four different ecosystems. Blockspace is the key resource supplied by blockchains, which allows users to transact. Considerable infrastructure has now seen the light of day towards refining blockspace and delivering more value across the stack, from users to the protocol. But blockspace is not an homogenous resource, being deeply tied with both the consensus protocols which supply it and the infrastructure which refines it. Comparing notes between ecosystems will allow us to uncover best practices and opportunities to learn from one another.\n\n\nOur workshop will feature researchers and developers from four different ecosystems, represented by:\n- Robert Habermeier (Polkadot)\n- Sam Hart (Skip Protocol)\n- Jannik Luhn (Shutter Network)\n- BarnabÃ© Monnot (Robust Incentives Group @ Ethereum Foundation)\n\n\nEach speaker will present key facts about their blockspace, its design and its philosophy (4x 8mins each). After these opening remarks, we feature a panel moderated by Christopher Goes (Heliax) to dive into the deep questions (~40 mins). Expect resource pricing, MEV, base-layer encryption, composability and many other themes to be discussed!\n\n\nhttps://protocol.berlin",

    "desc": "Since 2019, weâ€™ve been studying the novel dynamics unlocked by crypto protocols, articulating new mentals model for understanding them, such as \"headless brands\" and \"squad wealth.\" Since our work on public goods and with our experience as researchers and builders, our thinking has taken a more deeply political turn as we consider the long-term impact of crypto protocols as institutional bodies.\n\n\n\nInstitutional legitimacy and accountability of actors are problems which recur time and again as critical themes in protocol development and operations. Attempts to solve these problems are very wide-ranging, drawing from notions of the state (DAO constitutionalism) to corporations (coin-voting shareholder governance). As a result, protocol work has become a byzantine maze of narratives and mismatched mental models which are often a poor fit for the technical affordances of blockchains.\n\n\nIn this keynote talk, we will share insights from 5 years of techno-cultural analysis in the crypto space. We'll then present several frameworks that reveal how accountability and legitimacy ariseâ€”or don'tâ€”in crypto protocols. Drawing from legal and political theory (featuring pirates), we'll share a political philosophy of crypto institutions that will help protocol stewards and core developers understand power, behavioral regulation, and even violence in the nature of the protocol.\n\n\nSam Hart is the Head of Product and Strategy at Skip, a team building MEV solutions that improve protocol sustainability and cross-chain UX.
