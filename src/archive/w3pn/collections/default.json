    "desc": "The Price of Privacy\n\nToday, we don't have a unit of measurement for privacy, like \"100 privacy units.\" As a result, the valuation of privacy remains very ambiguous, and perhaps it should be that way. Let's consider how people are actually paying for privacy and to what extent they are effectively paying for it. Additionally, let's think about what the actual value of privacy might be.\n\nLeona Hioki has been working in security and privacy since his college days. In 2018, he joined the Plasma research community and receiving an Ethereum Foundation Grant, he founded Intmax (https://www.intmax.io/).\n\nABOUT US\n\nWeb3Privacy Now is a think-and-Do-tank of hundreds of people, projects, and organizations committed to protecting and advancing civil liberties, decentralization, and open-source software.\n\nWe aim to manifest profound political and social change by advocating #privacy in the #web3 Era. With unified efforts, we carve out a path toward a more equitable, decentralized and freedom-respecting digital commons. \n\n→ https://web3privacy.info/",

    "desc": "Surveillance as a Social Disorder\n\nForms of social control are expanding rapidly — justified by the need to combat “terrorism”. \n#Surveillance shifts from the exceptional to the everyday, from \"dangerous\" classes to the general population. The crowd is no longer \"solitary\" and anonymous: it is \"naked.\" \n\nDigital images, facial recognition, and #data mining track and profile individuals, while video surveillance and #algorithms predict future actions. #AI analyzes vast data to predict behavior, leading to preemptive measures that compromise #freedom and autonomy. \n\nSoon, individuals may be judged by predicted behaviors, eroding dignity and autonomy in the name of \"#security.\" \n\nWhat dignity remains for a person who has become a prisoner of a past and a future entirely in the hands of others, from which they must resign themselves to being expropriated?\n\nAndrea Togni is a philosopher and a teacher also involved in Monero privacy policy group. \nCheck out his papers on privacy and surveillance: https://independent.academia.edu/\n\nABOUT US\n\nWeb3Privacy Now is a think-and-Do-tank of hundreds of people, projects, and organizations committed to protecting and advancing civil liberties, decentralization, and open-source software.\n\nWe aim to manifest profound political and social change by advocating #privacy in the #web3 Era.
