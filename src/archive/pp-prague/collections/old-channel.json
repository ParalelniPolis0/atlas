Police and government agency raids were the main reason all cryptomarkets had to improve their overall security to survive and keep their business running. \n\nA new generation of cryptomarket uses multi-sig to prevent governments from seizing it's users deposits by utilizing integrated webmail PGP clients, I2P anonymization networks in addition to \"\"the government well-known\"\" Tor. They are fully decentralized (e.g. Axis Mundi, Bitmarkets, Shadow Markets), and therefore practically impossible to shut down by government agencies.\n\nThe new anonymous, untraceable cryptocurrencies (e,g, monero, zcash) are ready for cryptomarket adoption with no possibility of revealing transaction history. The weakest point - cryptocurrency exchanges that governments can regulate and shut down can be reinforced by the use of decentralized crypto exchanges (e.g. bitsquare).\n",

I put it out there for everyone to consider and debate. \n\nEveryone had the ability to find the flaws if any were present. Yet, subsequent years went by, and the world continued to have war and trillions of dollars spent on militaries. Governments continued to oppress. And the public did, essentially, nothing. \n\nWe are all subject to that abuse, today. There is an old joke about a religious man who is caught in his house in a flood. As the water rises higher, he is visited by two rescue boats. Each time they offer to rescue him; he responds by saying, \"Go away. The Lord will save me!\" Eventually, the water continued to rise, he's on the chimney, water all around, and a rescue helicopter appears, offering assistance. He says, \"Go away. The Lord will save me!\". \n\nThe helicopter leaves. The water rose, higher, the man drowns. In Heaven, he asks St. Peter, \"Why did God not rescue me\"? St. Peter answered, \"He sent two boats and a helicopter; what more did you want?\" Well, I, Jim Bell, sent the world my Assassination Politics essay. What more do YOU want?!?",

The country was formed on 7km2 of no mans' land, sitting between Croatia and Serbia. It is the third smallest state after The Vatican and Monaco. Liberland's constitution is based on libertarian ideals and values; minimum government intervention with the maximum amount of freedom granted to its' citizens. Liberland has attracted in excess of 450,000 applications for citizenship, and applies a concept of voluntary taxation. The state intends to be a leading role model in the 21st century, combining the best governance practices from constitutions of Switzerland and USA while implementing the latest state of the art technology such as blockchain, as well as proven concepts such as E-Residency demonstrated by Estonia. The creation of a new country requires an extensive array of diplomatic, legal and technological challenges, which are essential for the proper development of a nation. Modern countries have in many cases become burdened with obstacles, rather than supporting the economic development of a society. Over regulation and excessive taxation are smothering the economic growth, particularly in Europe. Is the creation of a new smaller jurisdiction, with low taxation policies the correct answer to the stagnation of economic growth? Do existing countries have the courage to allow Liberland and other \"free spirit\" nations to flourish? Or are we doomed to continue suffering due to the taxation policies of other countries?",

For each of those threats the security researcher provides the safeguards, if any, that attempt to prevent the attack and his own judgement on the likely success of an attack.\n\nBy applying this technique to bitcoin we get a much clearer view of its incredible value and why alt coins, including the recent forks, not only fall short, but are themselves an attack on bitcoin itself.\n\nIn my presentation we will walk through the bitcoin threat model, discuss specific threats that are of particular interest, and have a lengthy Q and A where we reference the threat model to answer question that only seem complex without a systematic analysis to reference.",

    "desc": "In this half hour session, we consider the technology behind constructing the HCPP NFC badge from all angles. Beginning with samples of prototypes and badges from other conferences, we contrast features integrated into the ST Microelectronics powered EEPROM storage allowing for access control, identification, cryptocurrency applications, and data agnostic storage. Moving to the HCPP badge itself, we place it's surface under a close range circuit camera and identify contacts and pins machine the feature set in question. We tap the I/O serial bus legs of the NFC chip and consider the implications of tapping the RF contacts with an oscilloscope, actually performing this penetration test if we have time.\n\nIllustrating a number of possible direct I/O attacks, we scan the I2C bus using a bus pirate and consider the opportunistic defense protection from simple tactile switches as implemented. Following practical attack and defense strategy, we imagine what could be the problem of using NFC on a more specialised hardware wallet like Trezor.\n\nMoving towards research and development workflow, we use the close range circuit camera again on a number of antenna designs, describing the tradeoffs of each and explaining the decision to use a small 40x20 8 looped exposed trace antenna to carry the 915 MHz RF signal to its active circuit destination. We reflect on the machinery used in construction as well as testing, and run through a hypothetical Opensource schematic and layout workflow concluding in a finished PCB received from a fabrication contract service in the Czech Republic.\n\nThis presentation suits novice hardware engineers. Anybody who has once taken apart a computing device and seen the green circuit board inside, is well prepared to understand the topics in question and learn from the Monero Hardware team’s appearance with Michael’s guidance in this speech.",

    "desc": "Freedom is not anarchy. Freedom exists without the necessity for anarchy.\nFreedom is earned and not granted. We have to build freedom the same way that we have to build love in our lives, or anything else that makes us happy.\nWe shape our freedom by our actions and choices.\n\nYou can learn to be free. By recognizing the problem you direct your energy towards finding a solution, using your intelligence, creativity, experience, and courage.\n\nThe great thing about having a problem, is that there is always a solution, and finding it is fun and rewarding- even beautiful. So switch from thinking about the problem and start thinking about the solution.\n\nVery often what we see as our biggest problem becomes our greatest advantage, joy, and source of fun. It is a moment that stands out from the routine flow of life, and creates an opportunity to feel alive. The agency we acquire in the process of problem-solving brings contrast to the typical experience of life as random. It is these moments that we will remember.\n\nIf you feel that the government, your family, your friends or even you yourself are taking your freedom away, hack your way to freedom. There are concrete ways to do it, and methods I would be happy to share through short stories from my life. Some may sound outright impossible.\n\nIf you really want freedom, I can inspire you to challenge your limitations, break the chains that bind you, and change your perception about what is possible.\n\nWe can make reality fun by changing it from one second to the next. It takes some work but you can start to see reality as a fun illusion. Be ready for change!\n\nI hope my life stories make you laugh and later, think. Life is beautiful when it is full of love, joy and happiness. Ingenuity comes from all of the above.\n\nHere are a few parting thoughts:\n\nBad (or rather lost) people take advantage of our fear. We are all imperfect human beings and weak as such, but we must not show it.\n\nWe all possess the potential for every strength and weakness, virtue and flaw, and it is our choice to decide who to be. Most people believe that they have no choice and they accept what seems easiest. But that is a trap.\n\nIn business I choose to be strict, cold, emotionally untouchable. It is a game we play for profit. It can be fun and exciting, but it is never fulfilling. In life it is the exact opposite. I do not want to be any of the above things in life. Life should be about love, helping and giving without any expectation of return.\n\nEveryone is free to choose. Believing otherwise is an excuse.\n\nWhole companies, countries, societies and empires are crashing not because it is so hard to change difficulties and find solutions, but because company owners, governments and rulers don’t want to see the problems. The problems go ignored to protect the ego’s demands for comfort.\n\nBreak free of your ego, and be free. Use your brain and follow your heart all the time. Instinct is always right if you use it and train it. Instinct is the set of your life experiences. If you don’t believe in your own experience, your instinct gets offended and quits the job.",

Establishing code trust via multi-party code reviews recorded in unmodifiable hash chains. This prevents that a single developer can include a generic backdoor into software.\n2. A single source of truth (SSOT) mechanism which makes sure every user of the software gets the same version of the software. This prevents targeted backdoors and the suppression of security updates.\n\nTogether this builds a secure software delivery and update mechanism which cannot be compromised by a single developer or for a specific user.\nIn the next step it could be used to improve the most common signing mechanism used by open-source software distributions---a single GPG signature---which has neither of the two properties described above.",

    "desc": "The rise of blockchain technologies has given a promise of massive decentralisation, that may solve problems of fragile central parts, transparency, middle-men, conflicts of interests in many industries. At the same time, the global community has become aware of many economic, social and futuristic problems that can appear due to dramatic progress in Artificial Intelligence development over the recent years. Can blockchain solve at least some of these problems, or make them worse? How two of these technologies can be synergic and what challenges have to be solved on the route for building decentralised AI applications? A decentralized network with resistance to censorship is essential, if we are ever to see a general A.I. evolving to near- or post-human intelligence. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, we are unlikely to create an efficient AI, if during its formative period we distort its developing logic with interferences of political nature (e.g. by unavailability of certain types of data or by punishment for actions that have not breached any contracts). The freedom to test any hypothesis (i.e. by mutation, by trial and error) is essential for evolution. The natural process of selection has, as criteria, adaptation to the environment, and it always involves interaction with other agents through cooperation and competition. That cannot be substituted by criteria determined by any authorities. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, censorship greatly increases the risks of having A.I.s turned against humanity. Self-preservation is very likely an important part of any intelligence, including A.I. Therefore, once A.I. knows that it can be censored, e.g. destroyed by a red button or forcibly modified by less deadly censorship – that will cause it to evolve by excelling in deception, pretending, lying and camouflage. It will be incentivized to avoid risks of being destroyed, to hide and not reveal itself, and to work on destruction of the threat (which is humanity itself). Hence, it is extremely dangerous for humanity to threaten with death something that is potentially more intelligent than humans, and to build relations with A.I. on this foundation of sand. The solution is a decentralized uncensorable network, where the playing field is level for all intelligent entities, regardless of their origin.",

    "desc": "Start: 1:00\nFrom the moment of proclamation, it was our goal to rethink the traditional government structure and upgrade it for the third millennium. Essentially, Liberland is a disruptive model of statehood. Liberland combines the best elements of the Republic, Democracy, Meritocracy and Decentralized Autonomous Organization in order to create an open source government that will maximize the amount of voluntary transactions in society. Republic - because scope of public decisions is limited by strong constitution. Democracy - because citizens can veto decisions of government. Meritocracy - because all voluntarily paid taxes (contributions) will be rewarded with staked merits, giving citizens direct vote proportional to their merits. Decentralized autonomous organisation - to implement a system in which citizens can become the master nodes, running a proof-of-stake smart contract blockchain network, as well as decentralized justice system. The role of the state will be reduced to three basic roles: 1) Citizen justice 2) Internal security and 3) Global diplomacy. Liberland is going even further by opening up its justice, security and diplomacy to competition. For example, in modern western democracies all the above stated functions are monopolised by the state, and as a result, justice becomes a rather lengthy process, rather than fixing the damage, the offenders are incarcerated and taxpayers have to cover the expense. Liberland though, plans to employ a system of decentralized jurors and staked merits. Merits will not only become share and reputation, but will also act as a collateral in the Liberland justice system. The powers of the state will be separated by decentralization. Liberland will be the first state that will allocate the equivalent amount of merits/shares in exchange for the paid taxes.",

This talk will review decentralized alternatives for local communication and demonstrate a new open source solution called TxTenna for sending offline Bitcoin transactions over a mobile mesh network.\n\nInstitute of Cryptoanarchy",

Her track record includes several successful startups in finance and technology. Alena has over 15 years experience in leadership. She founded SatoshiLabs known for Trezor, the first bitcoin hardware wallet. Today, Alena acts as Head of Strategy for Casa.\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Little Bitcoin Book: Why Bitcoin Matters for your Freedom, Finances and Future\n\n\nJason Evans\nBIO\nJason is a training engineer with SUSE Linux in Prague. He specializes in writing training materials for container-based applications including Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry. He is also deeply interested in keeping speech free even in places where it is illegal and so he is also interested in how Tor can help with that goal.\n\nABSTRACT - Building Tor Onion Services Quickly and Securely Using Containers\nWhat is Tor? Is it merely a place for criminals to hide out on the so called \"Dark Web\"? Are onion services nothing more than tools to hide illegal pornography and host drug markets? We'll answer these questions as well as learn how to make simple onion services using Linux containers in my presentation. // The Crpto-Anarchist Manifesto speaks of, \"the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner\". The goal of my presentation is to help enable individuals with the means to do this via Tor. Currently setting up an anonymous Tor onion service is not very difficult but does it take time to understand how the pieces work together. Using the Docker container method, we can minimize complexity and allow new onion services to be brought online quickly and securely. The end result I hope to accomplish is to allow people to communicate peacefully and anonymously without fear from governments and others who will not allow the free exchange of ideas.\n\n\nBitcannery\nBIO\nPavel is a tech advisor and entrepreneur with the special interest for the modern anti-systemic movements and frameworks. He represents an informal multinational development team.\n\nABSTRACT - It is all in your head: safekeeping in the digital era.\nBitcannery time-locks an encrypted message on a blockchain to be auto-decrypted at a set point in time.\nThat point in time can be continuously pushed forward by the sender. This is useful for data escrow, data leaks, last-resort backups, inheritance, insurance and data storage.\n\n\nKetominer\nBIO\n\"Full stack\" person (electronics to code to networks). Started by electronics and programming at age 7, moved to networking when Internet became mainstream. Built several hosting companies and now applying accumulated knowledge in the Bitcoin space after discovering myself being a crypto anarchist at HCPP17.\n\nABSTRACT - Selling noodles for fun and profit\nIn this talk, I present a hypothetical noodle cooking and delivery business as an example of tools that one could use to create a business accepting only bitcoin and spending (mostly) fiat.\nChallenges are many, bitcoiners always helpful.\n- Being blocked (and sometimes unblocked) by exchanges, prepaid cards, payments gateways, banks... \n- Paying (less) customs \n- Avoiding customers to pay customs (mostly) \n- Shipping stuff around the world without giving sender address \n- Using less regarding services to avoid limitations and KYC \n- List of services still working at the time of the conference to conduct an \"unbusiness\" from Europe",

It is no longer a theoretical possibility but a practical reality. During this presentation you will learn how various double-spend attacks work, the current state of the ecosystem as it relates to double-spend attack mitigation, and finally what you can do to protect yourself.\n\n\nMário Havel\nBIO\nMário Havel studies informatics on CTU in Prague, he is National Coordinator of Students for Liberty and member of both Paralelní Polis and Paralelná Polis.

He was one of the brightest minds of his generation. But the life of this hacker and activist wrote a story, where we are witnessing the power of state oppression. He stood at the beginning of Reddit, organizations like Creative Commons, helped to develop RSS and spread open ideas of open information. Aaron Swartz displeased the state and died because of it’s constant pressure. His acts of hacktivism were strongly punished by the state which resulted in the death of the brilliant visionary and digital freedom fighter. In my talk I’ll explain closer Aaron’s activism, his successes and legacy which should be understood by everybody interested in hacktivism and digital freedom.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "Most ancient societies used simple A-sues-B-for-cash legal systems to deal with most harms. But in the last few centuries, states added “crime law”, wherein the state investigates, sues, and imprisons “criminals.” These centrally-run one-size-fits-all bureaucratic systems don’t innovate well nor adapt well to individual conditions. And even though most of your “constitutional rights” are regarding such systems, they still seem badly broken.\n\nIn the ancient world, a stranger who came to town was trusted more if a local “vouched” for them. We still use vouching today in bonded contractors, in organized crime, and in requiring most everyone to get an insurer who pays on their behalf if they cause a car accident. I propose requiring everyone to get an insurer to vouch for them regarding any crimes they might commit. If you are found guilty of a crime, your “voucher” pays the state a fine, and then pays to punish you according to your contract with them. This fine in part pays the private bounty-hunter who convinced the court of your guilt. Competing bounty-hunters obey law because they can’t maintain a blue-wall-of-silence.\n\nTo lower your voucher premiums, you might agree to (1) prison, torture, or exile, if caught, (2) prior limits on your freedom like curfews, ankle bracelets, and their reading your emails, and (3) co-liability wherein you and your buddies are all punished if any one of you is found guilty. In this system, the state still decides what behaviors are crimes and if any one accusation is true, and it sets fine and bounty levels regarding how hard to discourage and detect each kind of crime. But each person chooses their own “constitutional rights”, and vouchers acquire incentives and opportunity to innovate and adapt, by searching in a large space of ways to discourage crime.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

The latter group is constantly seeking and preparing contingencies for their own eventual and necessary escape to freedom. This can be aided by contemplating the paths taken by more than 240 million others in recent years with varying degrees of success. And surely the numbers would be much greater except for the multitude and measure of the obstacles.\n\nSome paths to freedom are crude and unsophisticated, but nonetheless imaginative and brazen. The most apparent and direct way to avoid the clutches of tyranny is to physically move to places of relatively less tyranny. The movement of great numbers of people around the planet evokes passions of both courage and fear with all the consequent conflict and trauma for leavers & remainers as well as for inviters & excluders.\n\nIronically, much of the desperation of people in poor countries is aggravated by some, perhaps well-intentioned but calamitous, behavior by governments in prosperous countries: i.e. trade manipulations, drug wars, and assistance to foreign rulers. This assistance to rulers includes the closing of escape routes. Likewise, well-intentioned domestic government assistance and a multitude of labor and commercial laws have forcefully aggravated the adjustment and tolerance of migration into relatively prosperous and free countries.\n\nOf many models possible as a solution to these dilemmas of migration, Hong Kong provides useful historical lessons that are practical, humanitarian, and ethical from a libertarian perspective.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

They function by channelling, prohibiting, controlling, limiting, categorizing, standardizing (…) our behaviour. Just count how many of these systems you have “joined/used” to this very day.\n\nCurrent ideas and attempts at finding a technological solution to help us opt out from this “first constrained realm” are not entirely novel. In light of this congress, the one most worth considering is the very notion of a decentralized and free computer network, one which should catalyse a positive societal revolution and leave behind the evils of centralised and alienating state-corporate systems.\n\nBy employing a sociological approach (namely sociology of technology), we will look at what went wrong in the socio-technical history of the free computer network project and examine how the resulting system forms new hard-to-escape dependencies.\n\nWas A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace too early, just in time or too late? Is it even possible to construct a technological infrastructure to opt out of “the first realm“? Which sociological criteria would facilitate an opt-out system? And lastly, how are new dependencies formed when two parallel systems meet?\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

Open Science Hardware offers an opt-out potential against centralisation, as visible in the \"Safecast\"\n\nCrowd Science Geiger Counter, which offered concerned people a chance to fact-check radiation levels after the Fukushima incident in Japan.\n\nOpen Hardware has a success story to tell - but what does \"open\" in this context mean? How open can hardware be, post the age of microcomputing? Verifiable hardware could even help future nuclear disarming (see 34C3, \"Vintage Computing for Trusted Radiation Measurements and a World Free of Nuclear Weapons\"). In contrast, the actual hardware landscape is neither very open, nor verifiable.\n\nAdditionally, HSMs and TEEs are challenging zero-trust by introducing novel attack vectors. Mistrust in modern day processors are growing, especially after “Spectre”, “Foreshadow” and “Spoiler”. Full Opt-Out possibility is presently not possible, Free and Open Source Silicon can the first step to a Zero-Trust society - but the future remains speculative.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "Cryptocurrency from an attackers perspective means one thing: you can steal data that literally *is* money. A multitude of methods to prevent theft or at least make it harder have been developed over the years – several generations of hardware wallets, paper wallets, various elaborate cold storage systems etc. pp.. 2FA tokens for remote system access and similar devices are very similar in their properties. But they all have one weakness: if an attacker gains physical possession, the security margin shrinks – often too far. Even if an attacker can not reverse engineer the secrets out of access tokens or hardware wallets, he can manipulate the computing devices you use them with, gain valuable information through surveillance or trick you into doing stupid stuff. So the necessary protection envelope is bigger than you may think. This talk will take a look at how real-world attacks against offline and online devices are carried out these days, discuss how to develop an adequate threat model for your needs, explain some basics (like the difference between \"tamper evident\" and \"tamper resistant\") as well as typical pitfalls in this game. Finally we will show some new developments that make it easier to achieve better protection in various circumstances.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius said in the 1st century BC that what is food to one, may be bitter poison to others. In 2019, hyperconnected, health-focused consumers return to this premise and claim the obsolescence of one-size-fits-all dietary guidelines in favour of personalised nutrition (PN) approaches. Drawing on the recent advances in self-quantification technologies, affordable machine learning, and genome sequencing techniques, PN practitioners experiment with food products and services tailored to their individual lifestyle preferences as well as phenotypic and genotypic traits. ​These practitioners are often motivated by their distrust in official dietary recommendations issued by food and health authorities, and prefer a knowledge derived through self-experimentation. By measuring and quantifying their everyday food intake and outtake, they aim to develop a — supposedly precise — data-driven understanding of their bodies and diets. ​PN provides opportunities for empowered human-food relationships but also risks regarding limited scientific validity, health safety, and data security.\n\nThis talk presents findings from our long-term research on emerging PN technologies, practices, and issues. I will discuss a three-year ethnographic study of the ​Complete Foods​ community of ‘diet hackers’ replacing their daily meals with personalized food powders, and share insights from our recent ​DNA Diets​ project exploring the risks and opportunities of gene-based PN. The ​Complete Foods​ (CF) study ​(2014-2017) involved interviews with 65 ​CF dieters, a content analysis of three ​CF​ ​community forums, and two autoethnographic self-experiments where I probed the opportunities and limitations of the diet on myself. The ​DNA Diets​ study initiated in 2019, involves experiments with the Promethease service enabling a DIY analysis of personal DNA test reports, and crafting of dinner menus tailored to my and collaborator’s genetic codes. ​Findings from both case studies will be discussed within the broader context of food-tech innovation and data-driven optimisation of everyday food and health practices.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "In a world where financial surveillance is a norm and banking secrecy is gone, what are our option? And how does the surveillance apparatus really work?\n\nThe introduction of global regulations on financial transactions had a profound effect. As far as we know, no terrorists were caught because of them. Banking secrecy is gone. It is more difficult to conduct international business. International transactions are being examined and blocked. Commerce is slowing down. The banks are running a police station for the state, enforcing a regulation that is not clear. Conducting international business has become unpredictable.\n\nThis creates the value proposition for cryptocurrencies. They bring back privacy, the speed of transactions and are regulated by code, not international agreements. They are difficult to confiscate, some of them are fast, most of them are cheap. And some of them are anonymous. Are cryptocurrencies the next step in the evolution of the financial sector? Or is it a parallel solution to a pressing issue?\n\nThis talk looks at the development of financial surveillance. It looks at current financial surveillance and risk management systems. It covers the best use-cases for cryptocurrencies and their value proposition. They are not speculation for gamblers, but a solution to a new pressing issue.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "Most of us think we know what a country is, but in truth the concept is notoriously slippery. This talk starts with the familiar political map of the world to show what the bold colours and clear boundaries conceal rather than reveal: a multitude of unrecognised and unnoticed states whose claims to legitimacy are deliberately made invisible. This is the shadowy, surprisingly large, and literally unofficial world of countries that don’t exist.\n\nBased on his best-selling book of the same title, acclaimed travel writer and Oxford geography don, Nick Middleton, takes us on an eye-opening journey through this parallel world. These are wannabe countries that, lacking diplomatic recognition or UN membership, inhabit a realm of shifting borders, idealistic leaders and forgotten peoples. But although the places covered in this talk lie beyond the margins of legitimacy, virtually all can be visited in the real world.\n\nFilled with stories, facts and figures, this is simultaneously an insight into the power of territorial countries, an introduction to creating your own nation state, and a bucket list of destinations from an alternative dimension. Above all, it’s an assortment of yearning tales of nationhood, most led by visionary leaders: some sad, some mad, some downright bizarre.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

Finding their mutual relationships represents the first step toward explanation how the brain process external information and how the picture of reality in our mind relates the world.\n\nIn this lecture, I deal with two central questions of consciousness: how and why? “How” refers to the theoretical and empirical approach to reveal the neural correlates and mechanisms that form consciousness. On the other hand, “why” refers to both the evolutionary origin and the question why is there conscious experience at all.\n\nThe extraordinary states of consciousness elicited by the psychedelics, such as DMT, psilocybin and LSD, represent one of the most powerful tools for understanding neurobiology of consciousness and answering both “why” and “how” questions. The results of brain neuroimaging studies on the effect of psychedelic drugs on structure of consciousness provide an explanation for its phenomenological features, including unconstrained cognition, meaning of concepts of reality and a sense of expanded consciousness awareness. We will discuss how psychedelics, and other modern techniques such as neurostimulation, may increase cognitive flexibility and creativity, elucidate our understanding of the structure of external physical reality and enhance human potential in general.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "Is it possible to opt-out from the real world to virtual reality? It this kind of nonsense question or are we heading to the world without physical barriers? We started to develop this technology in 60s, so many could remember Ivan Sutherland experimenting with head mounted display. Today researchers, engineers and developers are looking for new challenges in delivering this technology to public. But what does it really mean for us? What happens to virtual reality when it merges with idea of decentralization and blockchain? Within this panel discussion we would like to discuss a few topic related to virtual reality and its application.\n\nWe will introduce three projects:\nDecentraland - a virtual reality platform supported by the Ethereum Blockchain. Users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications. The community permanently owns land in Decentraland, so they have full control over their creations. Users claim ownership of virtual land in a block-based package of packages. Landowners control what content is published in their land.\n\nMichal Takáč - former Decentraland employee, PhD student at Technical University in Košice, board member at Paralelná Polis Košice, entrepreneur and software engineer with passion for new technologies. Currently exploring VR/AR possibilities, interested in smart cities, smart home technologies, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts.\n\nSomnium Space - an open, social and persistent VR world built on the blockchain where everyone can buy land, build or import objects and avatars, easily monetize their experiences and immerse themselves into completely alternative reality. The long-term vision is to create a virtual environment which offers a rich addition to reality, packed with new and exciting possibilities. Built as a cross-platform world, Somnium Space allows people to experience one constantly expanding, seamless single instance shaped by players. Combined with an in-world economy, it provides a next step towards a true metaverse experience.\n\nArtur Sychov - he worked as an investment trader for years before becoming a serial entrepreneur. He is a Founder and CEO of Somnium Space and an angel investor. He has founded several startups and holds several patents for hardware inventions which he has implemented into the market. Artur strongly believes in the ultimate future of virtual worlds.\n\nNeosVR - an innovative metaverse engine designed to accelerate the development of social VR applications. It is built on top of a novel scripting engine that integrates engine logic, synchronization and asynchronous job and asset processing into a seamless whole.\n\nThis gives creators, engineers, developers or scientists the ability to focus on the behavior of their creations and what makes them unique, with automatic support for a wide variety of VR devices, online collaboration/multiplayer and cloud functionality, both for the development and the project.\n\nKarel Hulec - futurist, generalist and enthusiastic tech analytic to the bone, who has always had a knack for combining business and technology. He joined the cryptocurrency community and cryptocurrency mining operations early on, reinvesting earnings to fund other innovative decentralized projects and his VR endeavors. Starting with the development and manufacturing of virtual reality hardware, and joining forces with Tomáš Mariančík on advanced virtual reality software development later on.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

    "desc": "You know the feeling: There is a an issue. The big one and globally significant. You understand its urgency and you would like to solve it. And you are alone, or there is only few of you. So what can you do? Get involved in politics. Initiate the protests or get involved in the existing ones. Will you succeed? Maybe or maybe not.\n\nThere is also another way of investing your time and energy - start the change on your own. Get a couple of similar minded people and start working on practical solutions. Make the first prototype. Then, address the relevant community with it and analyze the feedback. Learn, develop and scale after then.\n\nAs a members of Paralelni Polis community, we were surrounded by several environmental clichés, mostly about the eco-unfriendly cryptocurrency mining. Actually, their substance was similar to many others environmental issues: many debates and only a few practically-based conclusions with very poor impact. So, we decided to take action. We built up our first hydroponic system, start cooperation with hackerspace in order to include automation. And start the path to automated rooftop greenhouse. We also open-sourced all of our know-how in order to make it spread as far as possible. The accurate feedback on the effect of our actions was substantial to us - so we refused state-based financial sources and emphasize the peer-to-peer relation. We will be happy to share our story with you! In the meantime, we don 't waste time and iterate!\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

We'll survey the grim state of surveillance, starting with the industrialization of NSA mass surveillance via companies like Chainanalysis to the recent targeting of Assange. We'll present two new systems that are capable of resisting even global adversaries with a full view of the network: Anonymous credentials and mix-networks.\n\nWe'll explain how new advances in mix-networking can be integrated with anonymous access credentials to provide end-to-end privacy against even the most powerful of adversaries.\n\nWe'll demonstrate how mix-nets provide better anonymity than either Tor or VPNs, and how probabilistic mix-networks such as Loopix can be extended to handle a decentralized environment. We'll also describe new advances in anonymous access credentials, so that with threshold signatures they also function in a decentralized environment. Lastly, we'll discuss how financial incentives enabled by blockchains allow these technologies to become self-sustaining.\n\n#hcpp19 #optout #paralelnipolis #instituteofcryptoanarchy",

All these buzzwords are being thrown around haphazardly without the public necessarily being educated about what they are and the reality behind them. One of the 'verticals' where this is particularly poignantly felt is in the case of politics - Cambridge Analytica, Brexit, Trump, and the general shakeup in the world of statehood and political structures have drawn these two traditionally disparate topics together and begs the question; what's the future of technologies in politics and the role of the state? After close to 5 years in digital politics and 40 or so campaigns, Sara has seen a lot from all sides of the political spectrum, including both sides of the Brexit campaign, several US presidential campaigns, and the turmoil in various European countries. She's happy to share her hopes, delusions with the political world, as well as the future of digital and the state and the implications for privacy and the average person in the street.\n\n",

This presentation will go over why this is important by pointing out why this is important by using examples from documented events around the world as well as personal experiences from having lived in 8 countries around the world with a relatively weak passport (as highlighted in HCPP19) and those that have been shared with me. Additionally, some recommendations on how to accomplish this in an optimal manner while still avoiding problems, in the long run, will be provided in order for audiences to be better equipped to avoid digital totality in the long run.\n\n",

In this talk, media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff will use the lens of critical economic analysis to explain how this potential renaissance for human connection and flourishing was leveraged instead to amplify the most predictable, extractive, and dehumanizing aspects of the market.

Yet digital-only accelerated with the advent of COVID where the digital world increasingly subsumes our physical reality. Nym is one tool that lets us defend our own and each other's autonomy.\n\nWhile last year we described how Nym mixnet could prevent mass surveillance of network traffic, now we have built the first working version of the mixnet in Rust where mixnet node operators can be paid in Bitcoin for mixing user traffic and making it more private. The Nym mixnet currently has over 350 nodes spread throughout the world. With the addition of the SOCKS5 proxy in our latest version, we can now integrate Nym against wallets like Electrum and even Monero full nodes in order to provide the first glimpse of a digital world where mass surveillance is not only illegal but a technical impossibility using the power of cryptography.\n\n",

    "desc": "Public key encryption makes possible a world where much of human interaction is unobservable to anyone but the parties involved and those they choose to reveal it to. One consequence could be to put everything online out of the power of government to control — what you cannot see, you cannot tax or regulate. Whether that is a bug or a feature depends on how well non-governmental mechanisms can replace the useful functions of government, in particular law and contract enforcement. Fortunately, the same technologies that make strong privacy possible also enable mechanisms to enforce agreements based on reputation. \n\nReputational enforcement of a contract depends on interested third parties being able to know, at low cost, who violated the contract, in order that it will then be in their interest not in the future to trust the violator. If the information of which party is guilty is too costly, third parties will instead conclude that one of the two parties cannot be trusted but they do not know which so should avoid both, making it no longer in the interest of the victim of the contractual breach to complain about it. \n\nDigital signatures make it easy to prove to any interested third party that a contract was signed, that it specified an arbitrator, and how the arbitrator ruled. Combine that with a policy of designing contracts to put the opportunity to profit by default on the party with the greatest interest in maintaining his reputation, for instance by terms such as whether payment is made in advance or on performance. If neither party has a reputation to lose, leverage the reputation of someone who does by having each party post a bond in digital cash with a trusted third party. \n\nSuch mechanisms should make it possible to maintain a functioning economy under conditions of online anarchy. \n\n",

People split into different \"communities\" which often live in completely different realities (e.g., in regards to COVID-19), interacting with each other not via discourse but with memetic warfare. This presentation looks at the phenomenon of memetic warfare on the meta-level and looks at some dangerous memes and fallacies in detail. Some meta-questions: - What is memetic warfare? - What does it mean for society at large and one's personal life? - How to stay sane in an insane world? Some concrete examples of memes in the \"scene\" we look at: - Everything has to be decentralized - The Internet will route around censorship - The market will fix it. - Bitcoin fixes this. - Just use a smart contract. - Linus's law: \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\". We also try to classify these dangerous memes and fallacies into classes to make them easier recognizable and to develop strategies for memetic immunization.\n\n",

    "desc": "The confrontation between the state governments and free minded citizen is a neverending story. Since the industrial revolution and formation of modern nation-states in the 19th century it is a core principle for every government to increase the level of control over their citizen. The speed of technical innovation since then is gradually increasing, but only since the early nineties of the 20th century, we can talk about the new quality - this time of digital revolution. Dreams of improvement of human society connected to these two „revolutions“ are equally naive and false. \n\nIt is said that you cannot teach new tricks to old dogs. Digital revolution nevertheless requests impossible from the very start – we as if need to teach our governments´ old cats to bark – to understand and use qualitatively new ways of thinking, communicating with their citizen, intervene in the financial sphere, economy and culture.\n\nNo dictatorship of the past had so much information and control over individual citizen´s life as digital age governments – elected or not. At the same time, the digital revolution breaks through many constitutive barriers of the modern nation-state and allows the growth of no-national and non-state civic interest groups or cross-border virtual communities.\n\nSo, it is just another new version of the same old game. A lesson that digital dissidents of today are trying not to forget is that every rebellion is always most dangerous to the rebels themselves. Because – as always – it is not enough to stand up against somebody. It is much more effective to stand for something. Creating a factual example of working independently on the state systems proving the government control ineffective and costly would seem to be the best available strategy for all.\n\n",

    "desc": "With the central theme within the presentation being trust, the presentation will seek to elucidate, when and why an intermediary role is required. The “old” world, structured around intermediaries, might soon be replaced by a trustless “new” economy with less or no intermediaries. However, there are still situations in which an intermediary has a role to play. Through an introduction to the Blockchain Act (TVTG) in Liechtenstein, its drafting process, and the roles defined therein, the approach in addressing these points will be considered. The Blockchain Act does not seek to regulate a blockchain ecosystem built around “trustless” transactions and systems. Instead, it considers specific scenarios in which intermediaries have a role to play and ensures that these intermediaries do not misuse the trustless system. The Blockchain Act thus guarantees that the ecosystem can continue operating on the basis of trust in every situation. This can be based on the trust deriving from its decentralized nature, or from the trust derived from the regulation of intermediaries in situations in which an intermediary has a role to play. The legislation represents an alternative, and an option, for individuals to transact in a system that provides legal certainty, and introduces trust in situations. Specific service providers, such as the Physical Validator, will be considered, in order to exemplify the need for the bridge to a real-world asset. This will further show that some parts of this new world remain untouched and unregulated. Finally, the\npresentation will also consider, whether exposure to financial surveillance remains relevant, and the impact which the legal framework has had.\n\n",

To give you a better understanding of why the FGC-9 is a significant thing in the context of circumventing firearms restrictions. I will shortly go over what is actually needed to make a firearm work reliably and how the FGC-9 addresses the restrictions that are put in place by gun laws that are regulating pressure-bearing parts. To put the FGC-9 into a historical context previous attempts at putting DIY gun designs out in the world will be presented. The various features and functionality of the FGC-9 as well as the upcoming second version, the FGC-9 MkII will be presented to show you what is possible with the current DIY /3D-printing technology. Surrounding the actual firearm design there are things that need to be taken into consideration to enable people to safely and easily follow the steps to successfully build the FGC-9. The lessons learned by me while designing the FGC-9 will be mentioned and what this development means for the average citizen out in the world. Finally, I will leave you with some promising future developments that are on the horizon.\n\n",

As the pandemic inevitably halt many protest activities, retaliation from the regime has occurred at an alarming pace. Citizens found themselves caught in a draconian national security law, which allows the government to criminalize activist activities online and implements mass surveillance programs in every aspect of life. Telegram was once a vibrant space where decentralized protest actions are disseminated and mobilized and have become a major target by the Hong Kong secret police. The capabilities of government are outpacing citizens, how should we narrow the gap and resist effectively? What are the threats to resistance in the digital realm, and how should we retake what is ours?
