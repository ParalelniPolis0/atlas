There are no authorities or guardians we can rely on, except ourselves. The very nature of trust and identity has changed. Former values are being dramatically redefined. Former economies are disappearing and new ones are emerging. We have new tools that allow us to create new cloud societies without the interference of coercive authorities.\n\nOut of Chaos, a universe has emerged. Out of Chaos came life. Chaos is not destruction. Chaos is a new beginning and we can shape it ourselves.\n\nWe are entering an era of Chaos. The primordial formless matter before creation.\n\nNow is not the time to wait – the old will never return. It’s time to saddle up for change – by courageous pioneers, those who will become the new narrative, let our stories be its tribute! History doesn’t creep, history leaps. Get out there, spin it, experiment! Play, hack, innovate! Stretch the grey area between the newly created structures! Barbed-wire fences will not stop evolution. Use Chaos!\n\nThis is our time – the time of beginnings. Zoom out and embrace Chaos!\n\n",

If so, can these technologies help create a future where we do much more good than harm? How do we begin to wade through these questions?

The talk explores the notion of the digital self, the future ahead, and how decentralization can help.\n\nThe talk will first present some views on the digital self and the extended mind from a cognitive science perspective. Building on this, questions will be raised about the digital self and how our personal data is part of our extended mind. In addition, questions will be raised about what happens to our autonomy when digital twins are created by others or when our extended mind becomes autonomous, i.e., what the digital does to our sense of self. In this context, it is argued that privacy is essential as a protection against the hacking of our minds – not only for surveillance reasons but also as a protection against the dopamine economy. The talk concludes with some ways that decentralization can work for individuals – or are we as developers sometimes just paving the road to hell with good intentions?\n\n",

Advances in operations research and symbolic reasoning powered by the proliferation of micro-electronics surpassed human decision-making capabilities, replacing with ease human planners and schedulers. The last two decades also showed us how machine learning excels in continuous problem spaces, providing predictive capabilities across enormous datasets. As intelligent automation systems grow and evolve to encompass combinations of discrete (symbolic) and continuous problems, their complexity increases exponentially, making building such systems difficult with a linear software engineering force.

It has been embraced by individuals, businesses, and even national governments. We are truly witnessing the rise of the hyper-pizzanization of our world.\n\nYet, just as the pizza industry has evolved from sit-down restaurants to delivery services to frozen pizzas, the Bitcoin ecosystem has similarly moved from face-to-face transactions to third-party intermediaries. But just as frozen pizzas can never truly replace the experience of a freshly-made pie, third parties can never fully replace the trustless nature of P2P transactions.\n\nWe believe that using Bitcoin as intended, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system can create a more secure, efficient, and fair financial system. We reject the need for third parties and spofs and extol cryptography to empower truly trustless systems. P2P technologies not only enable more robust and smooth economic structures, but most importantly they bring global coordination without the need for hierarchies. Still, we must resist the temptation to build walls and instead strive to create bridges, fostering a culture of technological meritocracy and collaboration.\n\nAs contemporary cypherpunks, it is our duty to fight for the ideals of decentralization and trustlessness in the face of challenges from governments, the public, and even within our own communities. As Bitcoin allows us to connect directly with one another without the need for trusted third parties, so too can we envision a future where pizza enthusiasts can savor their favorite dish without intermediaries.\n\nJoin us in the fight for a decentralized future where the power of peer-to-peer technology enables true pizza freedom for all. Let us embrace the power of the pizza-to-pizza revival and celebrate the genuine spirit of the original Bitcoin pizza transaction.\n\npizza-to-pizza || p2p || peer-to-peer\n\n",

As the demand for Bitcoin transactions rises, questions about network capacity, transaction speed, and fees become increasingly urgent. The decentralization ethos that underpins Bitcoin’s essence faces challenges as the community navigates the delicate balance between scalability and maintaining the trustless nature of the network.\n\nThe Scaling Wars encompass not only technical considerations but also ideological discussions about the very soul of Bitcoin. Should we prioritize on-chain scaling or explore layer-two solutions? How do we ensure inclusivity and avoid centralization without compromising efficiency?\n\nTogether, we can navigate the challenges of scaling, foster innovation, and ensure that the original spirit of Bitcoin thrives in the face of adversity.

For inevitably, cybermoney controlled by markets will transcend fiat money issued by states. The high priority is to step up our game and start moving towards the realization of this eventuality.\n\nWe must get back on track, and formulate a paradigm that can enable us to unlock the original promise still latent within this tech. But still important questions remain on metaphysics, philosophy, strategy, and tactics. This panel will discuss the core heart of our movement- its vision.\n\n",

The rapidly expanding legal aggression against privacy tools for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is beginning to show clear signs of desperation by the U.S. government. If they can’t outright prevent the use of these decentralized and autonomous tools, they’ll instead turn to legal and regulatory pressure to leverage fear and uncertainty as chilling agents against the privacy-focused developer community.\n\nThe DOJ has shown themselves in the indictment to either be willingly manipulating the public by putting forward a false view of Tornado Cash, or simply not understand Tornado Cash at a fundamental technical level. To dispel the fog of war being placed by the DOJ in this indictment, let’s walk through what Tornado Cash is and how it works first.\n\n",
