Starting with China's digital landscape, we'll expand to examine global challenges and solutions in the fight for online privacy and free speech.\n\nWe'll analyze the evolving ecosystem of privacy-preserving tools and techniques, showing how innovations sparked by restrictive environments can be applied globally. Our goal is to provide actionable insights for privacy advocates, developers, and users facing various threats to digital freedom.\nThroughout the talk, we'll draw connections between privacy challenges and solutions across various global contexts. We'll examine how techniques developed in response to China's digital environment can be adapted worldwide. Brazil's attempts to regulate social media and France's stringent data protection laws will serve as additional case studies, highlighting the universal nature of the struggle for digital rights.\n\nWe'll explore how platforms like Signal navigate the complex landscape of global regulations while implementing features such as end-to-end encryption. The discussion will touch on the challenges faced by founders and companies in this space, illustrating the real-world complexities of operating global communication platforms in diverse regulatory environments.\n\n",

Now, 5 years later and having gained a new passport, among other things, he has solved many problems, encountered new ones, and deals with some of the same ones he had before. However, the problems that he solved were only for himself and the greater problem remains. This talk will go over what he's done and why he's done it, as well as some additional information gained along the way that may be helpful for those seeking to expand their flag theory footprint. For those who attended his talk in 2019, he will also address discuss immigration issues he had to address with 2 more countries that he did not get to go over in 2019.\n\n",

There are ways to take our online lives back, but it needs a bit of a cypherpunk mindset, and willingness to experiment. Reticulum is a low-level mesh network when the basic Internet infrastructure fails. We can run it in cities over radio. Nostr is a protocol for publishing content, building social graphs and building replacement for Twitter/X, Instagram, but also Meetup, maps-based apps and many other things. And most of it (somehow) works today. If you are a bit cypherpunk and not a normie, come over!\n\n",

I will address why it's important not to use one phone number for everything, how mandatory SIM card registration works, and what alternatives exist for maintaining privacy. Throughout the talk, I will focus on the risks associated with deanonymisation through IMEI numbers and using the same devices in different locations. Examples of solutions include anonymous SIM cards, dedicated mobile phones, SMS forwarding, VoIP numbers, and anonymous eSIM services.\n\n",

Samourai Wallet brought me to Hacker's Congress and we have become eternal enemies, but what is the real story behind their arrest and what are our chances for getting out of this mess if the government declares them guilty on all counts? What could happen and what can companies do to either \"comply\" or be subjugated. Can there be profit made in this space, or this is the end? What we can find out by the end of Wasabi Wallet?

But while the streets are governed by the state, the Internet lacks a formal governing body.\n\nThis has led to a centralized, monopolistic situation where a few large corporations practically govern the web. The result is a Web where users are being manipulated, their privacy ignored, or they live in a state of insecurity of being blocked out of platforms their life depends on. Due to the international nature of the Internet, regulators around the globe face difficulties controlling this situation.\n\nWhat is needed is a model for the web with an internal governance mechanism, controlled by the \"citizens\" of the web (Webizens).\n\nThe core principles of the Democratic Web are as follows.\n1. An alternative web to the current one that includes an internal governance layer.\n2. The governance layer is controlled by Webizens, which are citizens of the Democratic web.\n3. There is a naturalization process for users to become Webizens.\n4. The web is governed in a democratic process by its Webizens.\n\nTechnically this requires an updated HTTP protocol, an online identity system, and a decentralized blockchain-based infrastructure.\n\nFrom the political science side of things, we need an updated model of the Three Branches of Government model (legislature, executive, and judiciary branches) for a global purely online governance process.\n\n",

We may feel empowered by believing we've made choices based on our desires and identity, but in reality, most choices are limited by design. Whether it's choosing between a Samsung or an iPhone, using Twitter or Telegram, or preferring Apple over Microsoft, these choices are illusions.\n\nAs mentioned in The Matrix: \"Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without.\"\n\nThose who wish to take away our freedoms, the magicians behind these illusions, present their narrow-minded, cowardly neo-communist worldviews as the norm. They work tirelessly to promote a single path: you will own nothing and you will be happy. To them, privacy and freedom are dangerous tools. Like any narcissist or sociopath, they believe the only way to progress is through absolute control and manipulation. They have gaslighted most of our brothers and sisters into accepting their perverted ideologies and beliefs.\n\nWe reject this notion because we are not limited in our ability to think or imagine. We believe the world can be filled with light and progress without giving up our natural rights to expression and freedom.\n\nJoin me as I share my journey over the last 11 years, including the lessons, experiences, and hardships that have shaped who I am today.
