Bell explored sovereign cyberstates, network states, and the compelling financial and societal benefits they provide.\n\nThis panel was a discussion based on 'Farewell to Westphalia: Post Nation State Governance' a book co-authored by Jarrad Hope- Co-founder of Logos, Institute of Free Technology and Peter Ludlow, Author of' Crypto Anarchy, Cyberstates, and Pirate Utopias'. \n\nThe book explores the flaws of the nation-states, offering sovereign cyberstates and network states as alternatives. \n\nLinking in from the West Coast was Chapham University Law Professor Tom W. Bell, himself author of the influential book 'Your Next Government? From The Nation State to Stateless Nations'. This deals with the quiet revolution in governance, as agile, competitive special jurisdictions are challenging the nation-state model, promising more freedom, peace, and prosperity for all. \n\nThe panel was moderated by Sam Reynolds, a senior reporter at Coindesk.\n_______________________________\n\nSpeakers: \nJarrad Hope (https://x.com/jarradhope_)\nPeter Ludlow\nTom W.
