  The Parallel Polis project combines art, social sciences and modern technology. It is based on the ideas of freedom, independence and innovative development of society. One of the main concepts is the consistent effort to remain "state free". Parallel Polis operates completely without state participation. At the same time, it does not draw any funds from public finances, i.e. from money raised by the state monopoly through involuntary forced payments ? taxes.

  Parallel Polis is a non-profit organisation with the legal form of a 'society'. The structure of Polis is based on a membership base. The members of the organisation contribute to the running of the project financially or by their own activity. Each member shows interest in the main ideas of Parallel Polis and tries to spread them. These are new technologies, decentralization and cryptoanarchy. We see cryptoanarchy as a potentially reasonable variant of social order. Through our activities we try to contribute to the critical discussion of the related problems of our time.

  A part of the budget of Parallel Polis consists of income from donations. The donors' council of the association has a significant socio-economic overlap for Polis. It is made up of members who, through their monthly membership dues, help cover the most important costs of running the house, especially rent. If you would like to become a donor, please contact any member of Parallel Polis. The conditions for becoming a donor are a clean criminal record and a commitment to pay a monthly membership fee of a uniform amount of 15,000 CZK. In addition, we expect donors to make a personal contribution to the project, built on joint meetings, and to be willing to help meet our goals.

  Other income comes from the operation of the sub-projects and activities of Parallel Polis. We also occasionally rent out space in the building when it is not in use.

      The term cryptoanarchy describes the growing environment of the unregulated Internet, where unlimited data sharing and the development of the free market became possible by using anonymous tools such as decentralized currencies like bitcoin, and anti-spyware encryption tools.

      From the intervention of a live broadcast of Czech Television to the virtual interaction with politician’s mobile phones, we as members of the Ztohoven group are associated with hacking. The inspiration of technological innovation and it’s potential impact on society led us to a tight interaction with the hacker’s scene. As we understand the connection between the arts, science and technology as a tool to highlight the authoritarian tendencies which entered into our daily lives  with the development of modern technologies, we decided to join the international hackers network and to establish a hacker space called Institute of Cryptoanarchy.

      The aim of the Institute of Cryptoanarchy is to make available tools for unlimited dissemination of information on the Internet and encouraging a parallel decentralized economy, crypto-currencies and other conditions for the development of a free society in the 21st century.

      The main motive for us is the belief that censorship is not a phenomenon only in “the distant dictatorial world”.

      States and their security agencies globally control access to information and use the protection of intellectual property as an excuse to apply total censorship to control the available resources.

      The State on a global level  processes private mail and personal data, even though the European Court of Justice decided on the illegitimacy of “data retention”.

      The State and corporations have data on economic behavior, and through  legislation they have received  complete access to all payment transactions and consumer habits.

      New technology brings the possibility of choice – we are in a time that is defined by The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto.
      
      With a fast internet connection, reliable anonymity and decentralized currency, you preserve freedom which we have been losing as a society.

    description: |
      The legendary Bitcoin pizza transaction marks an important moment in the history of libre digital money. A small step, signalizing the birth of a whole era. It’s been 12 years since Bitcoin stepped into the world of payment networks for physical goods and opened the gates for the creation of a global parallel economy. Since then, we have experienced rather exponential growth in this new financial world. From a small community of cypherpunks and hackers, Bitcoin grew into a phenomenon with today’s mainstream recognition. Flourishing adoption upholds further levels, as the public interest always comes in waves. Yet with each wave passing by, the inspirational spirit of the original innovators fades a little bit more. Mass adoption poses continued challenges from governments, the public, and often the community itself. New questions about the purpose, scalability and sustainability arise every day. These are not going to solve themselves, nor disappear.

      This initiative honors digital freedom fighters with limited-edition silver coins, each tied to 0.01 BTC through secure BitNotes. Led by artist Roman Týc, it blends art, technology, and cryptocurrency, with only 100 coins minted per year.
    description: |
      The **Coins Project** is a series of limited-edition silver commemorative coins launched in 2017 under Paralelní Polis, with support from the Institute of Cryptoanarchy. The project honors individuals who have fought for digital freedom and internet independence, often facing persecution for their beliefs and actions. The figures commemorated so far include:

      - **2017**: Ross Ulbricht
      - **2018**: Julian Assange
      - **2019**: Aaron Swartz
      - **2020**: Edward Snowden

      Each coin is connected to the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, particularly **Bitcoin**, containing the value of **0.01 BTC**. This link is facilitated through **BitNotes**, which are paper notes with unique BTC addresses tied to the coin. These notes include security features and are guaranteed by Paralelní Polis, though the organization has no direct access to the coins' BTC.

      ### BitNote and Bitcoin Integration

      - BitNotes have unique BTC addresses corresponding to private keys guaranteed by the company.
      - Paralelní Polis acts as a guarantor, but cannot access the BTC associated with the coins unless the second half of the code hidden under a scratch-off on the BitNote is revealed.

      ### Art and Leadership

      The project is led by **Roman Týc**, an artist and activist from the **Ztohoven** group, who also founded Paralelní Polis in 2014. He has a history of using technology in his art and activism. The production process of the coins combines craftsmanship and technology, symbolizing the fusion of art, science, and decentralized currency.

      ### Limited Edition

      Each annual edition is limited to **100 pieces**, with the molds destroyed afterward, enhancing the collectible and technological value of the coins.

      Koncept Paralelní polis lze rozklíčovat návštěvou espresso baru Bitcoin Coffee. Obrácený princip baru se zakládá na otevřeném a sdíleném výrobním postupu. Využití papírové voštiny reprezentuje hledání nových možností známých zajímavých materiálů. Bitcoin jako platební prostředek přivádí pozornost návštěvníka k využívání nových kryptotechnologií v praxi. Koncepce kavárny po vzoru berlínské kávové špičky, značky Bonanza Café, jako kávové laboratoře zacílené na dosažení špičkové chuti pak vyvolává zájem o doposud neobjevené kvality života. Pro pochopení složitých témat Paralelní polis je důležité posilnit se douškem silné kávy.
